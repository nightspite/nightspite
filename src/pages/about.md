I'm a frontend developer with a passion for turning ideas into reality
through code. In my spare time, I like to dabble in backend development
and aspire to one day become a full-stack master.

When I'm not working on projects, you can find me tinkering on my side projects or trying to
turn them into profitable ventures. I consider myself an indie hacker,
always on the lookout for the next big opportunity to turn my passion
into a successful business. 

Until then, I'll keep honing my skills and
building cool stuff for the internet to enjoy.
