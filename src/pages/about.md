I'm a fullstack developer with a passion for turning ideas into reality through code.

When I'm not working on projects, you can find me tinkering on my side projects or trying to turn them into profitable ventures.

I consider myself an indie hacker, always on the lookout for the next big opportunity to turn my passion into a successful business. Until then, I'll keep honing my skills and building cool stuff for the internet to enjoy.

## Tech Stack

Don't care. Most of the things are written in Typescript using frameworks like Next.js, Nest.js or trpc as that's the fastest way to get projects of the ground and iterate over them until the problem of scale becomes a thing.

I use arch btw. (jk popOS or macOS)

## Dotfiles

soon...
